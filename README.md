# Analysis of Oyster Aquaculture Suitability
This project investigated the potential for oyster marine aquaculture in the Exclusive Economic Zones of the West Coast, US

## Goals

-   Determine the suitability area in the Exclusive Economic Zones of
    the West Coast
-   Illustrate what EEZ have the greatest percentage and area for
    suitable marine aquaculture
-   Create workflow to determine suitable marine aquaculture area for
    other species

## Visualizations

This project will have two visualizations in the `.RMD` file that
pertain to the analysis, and one that uses the function created at the
end of the analysis. The first shows the EEZ by **percent** of suitable
area for oyster marine aquaculture, and the second shows the EEZ by
**total area** of suitable area for oyster marine aquaculture. The final
visualization is a map of both the percent and the total area in the
Exclusive Economic Zones for the test species (eg. Clams).
